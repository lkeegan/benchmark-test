# Benchmark example

Based on https://github.com/benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark/tree/master/examples/catch2

Also needed to create a gh-pages branch:
```
# Create a local branch
$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
# Push it to create a remote branch
$ git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
```
And go to the github settings to enable github pages from this branch.
